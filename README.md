Setup Initial Values:

++++++++++ sets the first cell to 10, used as a counter.
>+>+ sets up two cells with initial values of the Fibonacci sequence (0 and 1).

# Fibonacci Calculation Loop:

[<+>-] is a loop that calculates the next Fibonacci number.
This loop takes the current two numbers, adds them, and moves the result to a new cell while preserving the last number of the sequence.
This process is repeated to generate the sequence.
Printing and Moving Values:

The section with multiple +, >, <, and . commands handles the increment of ASCII values to the correct number and prints each Fibonacci number.
The program uses ASCII character codes to print numbers, so each Fibonacci number is converted to its corresponding ASCII character.
Loop to Generate Multiple Numbers:

The entire Fibonacci calculation and printing process is enclosed in a loop that runs multiple times to print the first 10 numbers of the sequence.
